# SENG3011_TeleTubbies 
The EpiWATCH system utilises multiple accessible data sources to automate epidemic detection.
We are creating a REST API module to contribute to the EpiWATCH system by identifying disease
reports from the WHO data source and in the future, developing a web platform to bring epidemic
detection to end users.

## WHO API web service
Due to difficulties deploying the main repository (https://github.com/lavanya-sood/SENG3011_TeleTubbies/) to heroku, this repository is used for the API's web service mode. Note: not all files are found here, only the ones that are used for the current functioning of the API are included. 

Please refer to the main repository for reports, testing, scraping bots and more.
