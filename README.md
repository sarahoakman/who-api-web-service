# WHO REST API
![](api.gif)
The EpiWATCH system utilises multiple accessible data sources to automate epidemic detection.
We are creating a REST API module to contribute to the EpiWATCH system by identifying disease
reports from the WHO data source and in the future, developing a web platform to bring epidemic
detection to end users.

## Overview
This repository is used for the API's web service mode which is deployed on Heroku.
* Developed a REST web service with a clearly documented API using Swagger
* A database system was implemented and collected data from the WHO website
* Coded up web scrapers to collect disease reports from the WHO website
* API calls include GET, POST, PUT and DELETE calls
* API was tested through Postman and Pytests
